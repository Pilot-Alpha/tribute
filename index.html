                <p>The world kept silent as the aparthaid state of Israel continued to oppress the innnocent
                    civillians of Palestine in the name
                    of self defense. It didn't start from October 7, rather it began with
                    Zionism took its root in the middle east. It started from the Nakba in 1948.
                    For long, the rights of the Palestinian people have been undermined by the aparthaid
                    state of Israel and the world did nothing about it. So it was on the Palestinian people
                    to preserve their existence among the cruel oppression of the people of Israel. They took
                    on their fight, resisting the blame that was taken on them. But the world,
                    yet again sided with the Zionist terrorists, and played the blame game. They again gave 
                    the blame of the entire violence on the people of the Palestine. But they couldn't end the
                    resistance. This resistance can't be end. This will go on. Until Palestine is free.

            <h2>The Nakba (1948): The Original Ethnic Cleansing</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mass Displacement:</strong>Over 700,000 Palestinians were violently expelled from their homes during the Nakba ("catastrophe"), an act of systematic ethnic cleansing to establish the illegitimate state of Israel.</li>
                <li><strong>Deir Yassin Massacre (April 1948): </strong>Zionist gangs like Irgun and Lehi murdered over 100 civilians, including women and children. Pregnant women were butchered while the terrorists laughed.</li>
                <li><strong>Destroyed Villages: </strong> <u>500 Palestenian Villages</u> were obliterated to erase Palestinian identity, creating a fabricated narrative of “empty land.”</li>
                <li><strong>Rape and Torture: </strong>Survivors like recounted unspeakable horrors, including sexual violence against women, proving the immorality of Israeli militias.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Genocidal Campaign</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kafr Qasim Massacre (1956):</strong> Zionist forces ambushed and murdered 49 unarmed civilians, including women and children, as they returned home from work</li>
                <li><strong>Sabra and Shatila (1982): </strong>Israeli-backed militias <u>slaughtered 3,500 refugees</u> in Lebanon while the terrorist state’s military provided cover.</li>
                <li><strong>Jenin Refugee Camp (2002): </strong>A war crime disguised as "anti-terror operations," where dozens of Palestinians were executed, and homes were bulldozed with people inside.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Gaza: The World's Largest Open-Air Prison</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Operation Cast Lead (2008-2009): </strong><u>Over 1,400 Palestinians, including 300 children</u>, were massacred in three weeks by indiscriminate airstrikes.</li>
                <li><strong>Great March of Return (2018): </strong>Israeli snipers targeted medics, journalists, and disabled protesters. A former Israeli soldier, exposed orders to "shoot to maim and kill indiscriminately."</li>
                <li><strong>Testimonies of the Witness: </strong> Palestenian journalists documents how Israel targets pregnatn women, medics, and journalists in Gaza to ensure generations are wiped out.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Settler Terrorism and Apartheid</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><Strong>Settler Violence:</Strong> Armed, state-supported settlers regularly storm Palestinian homes, burn crops, and attack children while Israeli forces protect the attackers.</li>
                <li><strong>Olive Tree Destruction: </strong>Over one million olive trees—symbols of Palestinian heritage—have been uprooted as part of Israel's genocidal war against their culture and identity.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Whistleblowers and Condemnetaion</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch: </strong>Both organizations have classified Israel’s actions as apartheid and crimes against humanity.</li>
                <li><strong>Richard Falk (UN Special Rapporteur): </strong>He described Israel's policies as a "systematic ethnic cleansing project."</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Humanatarian Catastrophe</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Blockade of Gaza: </strong>For over 16 years, Gaza has been starved under a barbaric siege, denying 2.3 million Palestinians access to food, medicine, and clean water.</li>
                <li><strong>Targeting Children: </strong>At least <u>15,000 <strong>children</strong></u> were killed since October 7th. The death toll since the Nakba is just a speculation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>October 7 Onwards</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Since October 7, 2023, over 22,000 Palestinians in Gaza, most of them civilians, have been killed by relentless Israeli airstrikes. The bombings have targeted schools, hospitals, and residential buildings, with many attacks constituting war crimes under international law​</li>
                <li>The IDF has displaced 85% of Gaza’s population, forcing 1.9 million people into desperate conditions without adequate food, water, or shelter</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Resistance and the Global Outcry</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Despite the systemic repression, Palestinians have continued to resist through protests, cultural preservation, and international advocacy. Movements like BDS (Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions) aim to hold Israel accountable for its actions.</li>
                <li>Activists and organizations globally, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, are documenting abuses and urging international courts to investigate Israeli war crime</li>
                <li>However, some of the western media, countries (like the USA) continues to fund the genocide of the terrorist state and blocks anyone from trying to support this things. <strong>Shame on them</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Israel's actions over decades—from the Nakba to the present—demonstrate a consistent pattern of state-sanctioned violence and ethnic cleansing. The ongoing massacres in Gaza underscore the urgency for global intervention to end this cycle of terror and oppression. The blood stained hands of the apartheid and terrorist state of Israel can't go unanswered</li>
            </ul>
